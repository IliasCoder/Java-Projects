# â˜• Java Playground â€“ My Personal Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Java Playground** â€” a collection of Java projects Iâ€™ve built out of curiosity, learning, and pure passion.  
This repository is my creative corner where I experiment with ideas, explore algorithms, build mini-games, and develop tools that solve real (and sometimes fun) problems.

## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This is **not** a single project â€” itâ€™s a compilation of small to medium-sized Java applications, each living in its own folder.  
You might find:
- **Games** (Checkers, Tic-Tac-Toe, etc.)
- **Algorithms & Data Structures** (Sorting, Search, Graphs, etc.)
- **Utilities** (File handling tools, converters, CLI tools)
- **Experiments** (AI logic, design patterns, random ideas I had at 2 AM)

The main goals of this repo are:
- To learn and explore new Java concepts
- To have a personal reference for future projects
- To share examples with others who are learning
